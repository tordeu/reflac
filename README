#================[ Description ]========================================
#
# 	Reflac reencodes a flac file while preserving metadata. It was 
#	created to "repair" flac files that can not be used with oggenc 
# 	because of the way the metadata is stored. In those cases oggenc 
#	produces the following error message:
# 	  ERROR: Input file <file> is not a supported format
# 
#	Because reflac REPLACES the flac files, backing up the original flac
# 	files is encouraged in case something goes wrong.
#
#==============================[ Usage ]================================
#
# Usage:
#
#   reflac.sh <flac file>...
#
# Examples:
#
#   to reflac a single flac file named foo.flac, run:
#   
#		reflac.sh foo.flac
#
#	to reflac multi flac files (named foo.flac, bar.flac and what.flac):
#
#		reflac.sh foo.flac bar.flac what.flac
#
#	to reflac all flac files in the current directory
#
#		reflac.sh *.flac
